## Description:

- 
Dark-MoreHardStorms makes ICARUS far more hostile by increasing storm frequency, duration, and intensity. Weather phases last much longer, high-tier storms are common, and clear skies are rare. Survival now depends on preparation, timing, and strong shelters.
Longer storms, higher tiers, fewer clear skies — ICARUS becomes truly unforgiving.
A brutal weather overhaul where storms last longer, hit harder, and rarely give you time to breathe.
